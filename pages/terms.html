        <h2 class="title has-text-centered" id="terms">Terms and Conditions</h2>
      
        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with <a href="https://www.oopspam.com/">https://www.oopspam.com</a> website (the "Service") operated by OOPSpam LLC ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or OOPSpam LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting OOPSpam LLC customer support team.</p>
        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide OOPSpam LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize OOPSpam LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, OOPSpam LLC will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
        <p>It's strictly forbidden to create multiple paid accounts in order to circumvent limitations and quotas of paid subscriptions.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="free-trial">Free Trial</h2>
        <p>OOPSpam LLC may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
        <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
        <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by OOPSpam LLC until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
        <p>At any time and without notice, OOPSpam LLC reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
        <p>It's strictly forbidden to create multiple accounts in order to circumvent limitations induced by the free trial.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="fee-changes">Fee Changes</h2>
        <p>OOPSpam LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
        <p>OOPSpam LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
        <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by OOPSpam LLC on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of OOPSpam LLC.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="accounts">Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
        <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <p>We shall not be liable for any of your unlawful actions in connection to the usage of the Website, Platform, Configuration or Services with respect to third parties (e.g. breach of intellectual property rights, rights to the name or company name, unfair competition, breach of terms of websites or applications and programs of third parties).</p>
        <p>We shall not guarantee or be liable for the availability of the Website, Platform or Services (or products arising therefrom) or for their performance, reliability or responsiveness or any other performance or time parameters.

        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="your-obligation-to-indemnify">Your Obligation to Indemnify</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us, our agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and applicable third parties (e.g., all relevant partner(s), licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (“Indemnified Person(s)”) harmless from and against any third-party claim, liability, loss, and expense (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable legal fees), brought against any Indemnified Person(s), arising out of your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations or Services and/or your breach of any of these terms. You acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Person has the right to assert and enforce its rights under this section directly on its own behalf as a third-party beneficiary.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;" id="disclaimer-and-warning">Disclaimer and Warning</h2>
