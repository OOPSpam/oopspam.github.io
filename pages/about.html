                        <p>The project started as part of academic research in 2017, Italy. The same year, I (Onar) published it with online communities. My goal was, and still is, to have an anti-spam solution which respects people’s privacy while providing high accuracy.
                            Some of the users reached out to me and asked for more features, wanting to support the project. So, I started working on a commercial version and made it live in May 2019. Now, We work on it full-time.</p>
