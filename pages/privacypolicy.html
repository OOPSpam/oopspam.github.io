                 <h3 class="subtitle">Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
                 <p>It is OOPSpam's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://www.oopspam.com/">https://www.oopspam.com/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.oopspam.com/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                 <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
         
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Website Visitors</h2>
                 <p>Like most website operators, OOPSpam collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OOPSpam's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OOPSpam's visitors use its website. From time to time, OOPSpam may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                 
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                 <p>Certain visitors to OOPSpam's websites choose to interact with OOPSpam in ways that require OOPSpam to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that OOPSpam gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>
                 
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Security</h2>
                 <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                         
         
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Links To External Sites</h2>
                 <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                 <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
                 
                 
                 
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                 <p>OOPSpam may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. OOPSpam may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, OOPSpam does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
                 
                 
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Cookies</h2>
                 <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, OOPSpam uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to store your preferences on your computer. We do not display personalized content or advertising on our website.</p>
                 <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OOPSpam uses cookies to help OOPSpam identify visitors and store their website access preferences. OOPSpam visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OOPSpam's websites, with the drawback that certain features of OOPSpam's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                 <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to OOPSpam's use of cookies.</p>
                 
                 
                 
                             <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold" style="padding-top:20px;">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

                     We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided.

Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.
